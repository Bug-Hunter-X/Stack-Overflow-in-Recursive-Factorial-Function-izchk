This repository demonstrates a stack overflow error in Hack caused by a recursive function.  The `bug.hack` file contains the buggy code, a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number. When called with a large enough input, this function will exceed the program's stack size, resulting in a crash.  The `bugSolution.hack` file provides a corrected version using iteration to avoid stack overflow issues.  The solution replaces the recursive approach with an iterative one.  This approach prevents stack overflow by calculating the factorial without repeatedly calling the function. This example highlights the importance of considering stack size limitations when working with recursive functions and illustrates an effective mitigation technique.
